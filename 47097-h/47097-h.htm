<p>There, there, there! Don't
make such a racket or
you'll make me nervous.</p>

<p>The manager said to me this morning:
"Just give 'em a little nonsense,
Mr. Niblo. You know a
little nonsense, now and then, is
relished by the best of men."</p>

<p>That's the reason he engaged me; said
I was the most nonsensical man he ever
knew. That's right. Laugh at me. Oh, I dearly love
to see people's faces wreathed in smiles.</p>

<p>I've always been a seeker after fun myself.</p>

<p>Why, would you believe it, I once walked twenty
miles to thrash a fellow&mdash;just for fun.</p>

<p>What's that&mdash;twenty more miles back again?
Well, to tell you the truth, that didn't bother me.</p>

<p>You see, they carried me back in an ambulance.</p>

<p>I was thinking of telling you a ridiculous story
about the dirty window, but I guess I'd better not.</p>

<p>You wouldn't see through it, anyway.</p>

<p>Instead of that let me relate a few amusing things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
that happened to me while I was
on the road last
summer.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 224px;">
<a href="images/i004large.jpg"><img src="images/i004.jpg" width="224" height="400" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>I always start
in a Pullman, and
generally come
back&mdash;well,
what's the
use telling
family secrets?</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 254px;">
<a href="images/i005large.jpg"><img src="images/i005.jpg" width="254" height="400" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>While I was doing the Ohio theatres I spent some
little time with an old friend.</p>

<p>He is engaged in a country school, and for five
days in the week wrestles with the task of teaching
the young idea how to
shoot. I went to see him
at work, and of course the
scholars were more
backward than ordinary.
Just as the
baby will never
be cunning when
strangers are
around.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 385px;">
<a href="images/i006large.jpg"><img src="images/i006.jpg" width="385" height="400" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<p>It was a lesson in geography that quite broke me up.</p>

<p>"What is a cataract?" asked the pedagogue.</p>

<p>There was a complete frost.</p>

<p>No one had any idea apparently.</p>

<p>"Well, what is meant by a cape?" said my friend.</p>

<p>This was better. One of the children knew it was
a point of land jutting out into the water.</p>

<p>"What is a strait?"</p>

<p>Over in the corner a hand went up.</p>

<p>"I know, teacher," said a small boy.</p>

<p>"Well, what is it?"</p>

<p>"It beats three of a kind," was the triumphant
answer.</p>

<p>Feeling a little indisposed while at Sandusky, I
sauntered into an apothecary shop, intending to purchase
some mild drug, to the
use of which I am addicted,
and which usually comes to
us from Havana.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 255px;">
<a href="images/i007large.jpg"><img src="images/i007.jpg" width="255" height="400" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>As I stood a moment after
getting my light, an old country-man
came shuffling in.</p>

<p>He was a character, I'm
telling you; why, it stuck out
all over his furrowed face just like the
tracks of a lost hen in the mud.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<p>I saw him pull out a red bandanna handkerchief
and frown as he surveyed the big knot in the end.</p>

<p>You needn't smile&mdash;that old codger wasn't the
first man to forget why he had tied a knot in his
handkerchief or a string around his finger.</p>

<p>"Well, uncle, what is it?" asked the clerk.</p>

<p>"I'll get around to it pretty quick. Now, what place
is it down yonder on the lake?"</p>

<p>"Do you mean Put-in-Bay?"</p>

<p>"Yep, that's it. Now, who was it that put in
there?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps you mean Commodore Perry?"</p>

<p>"The very man. And I want a bottle o' Perrygoric."</p>

<p>I saw at once that man knew what he was after,
and was bound to get it.</p>

<p>Sandusky seems to breed that species.</p>

<p>Why, when I was at the station, waiting with a
big crowd for a train that was late, a wide-awake
chap pointed out to me a poorly dressed woman who
sat alone and apparently disconsolate.</p>

<p>"Look here," called out this fellow, raising his
voice and getting a crowd about him, arousing immediate
attention, "this poor woman has no ticket to
her destination. I'll chip in ten cents for her.
Who'll help?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<p>Presently he had a hat partly filled with coin,
which he dumped in her lap.</p>

<p>Then he called out again: "She has more than her
fare, but not enough for a shawl. She needs a
shawl; I'll chip in a quarter for that."</p>

<p>Again he made the round and again announced:</p>

<p>"She ought to have a bonnet. I'll chip in half a
dollar for the bonnet."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 284px;">
<a href="images/i008large.jpg"><img src="images/i008.jpg" width="284" height="400" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>When he made the
rounds the third time, a
newcomer entered the station,
shook hands heartily
with the woman, and turning
to the philanthropist, said:</p>

<p>"Why, Hiram, I'm glad to see
you and your wife again."</p>

<p>"How's this?" asked one of
the contributors while the rest of
us gaped. "Is this woman your wife?"</p>

<p>"Yes," drawled the philanthropist, grinning.</p>

<p>"What right have you to collect money for your
wife?" demanded several.</p>

<p>"What right have I to collect money for any other
fellow's wife?" was the retort that closed the debate.</p>

<p>I've never ceased to believe that fellow was the
nerviest bunco man I ever met.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p>I traveled down to Coney Island
the other day with a friend recently
married.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 340px;">
<a href="images/i009large.jpg"><img src="images/i009.jpg" width="340" height="400" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>They went to housekeeping, and
I suspect the little woman has
been bombarding him with
all manner of fearful dishes
which she insists upon
trying.</p>

<p>That's so like my Clara&mdash;- oh, so like! Did I ever
tell you about Clara? Well, I'll sing about her instead.
Listen:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">My Clara bought a gaudy book,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With colored pictures illustrated:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It teaches her, she says, to cook&mdash;-<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In other things she's educated.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, oh! she still her bread will burn,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Her steak is hard and she will fry it;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To cook I know she'll never learn,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Why will she try it?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I have a friend who wrote a book&mdash;-<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He means, he says, to write another,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The greatest fortitude it took<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To hear it read. I had to smother<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Some awful yawns. I'd have to call<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The man a silly fool who'd buy it;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But then poor Jones can't write at all,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Why will he try it?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I know a girl who loves to sing<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And does so at the least persuasion<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or none at all&mdash;an awful thing,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I know by one most sad occasion.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her voice might have some sort of use<br /></span>
<span class="i2">If to saw filing she'd apply it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But singing! She has no excuse.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Why will she try it?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And so it goes. Most people pant<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To do the things they're most unfit for&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To preach&mdash;to paint&mdash;we know they can't&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And what they can don't care a bit for.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perhaps we, too, our callings miss,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But tell us so and we'll deny it.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We still will fool with that or this,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Why will we try it?<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Good deal of truth there, you'll admit.</p>

<p>But speaking of Coney Island, many's the happy
hour I've spent on its historic sands. And perhaps
I've done my share at amusing the thousands who
throng there on a hot holiday.</p>

<p>Yes, I was the Mikado of the seaside.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p>That was in the days when I never dreamed I
should be standing before so brilliant an audience as
I see before me tonight, in such a magnificent
theatre, and under the auspices of such a generous-hearted
proprietor&mdash;that means another fifty per!
No, no, it was in the dear, dead days, when the
world was young. It makes me weep to think how
we fleeced&mdash;I mean entertained&mdash;those Coney Islanders.
We gave a little show on the sands, and
we had with us one jolly old actor who only once
attempted playing in the legitimate. I was curious
about that "once."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 207px;">
<a href="images/i010large.jpg"><img src="images/i010.jpg" width="207" height="400" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>When in a confiding mood I confessed
that I had heard of his
aspirations, he chuckled and admitted
that years back, growing
disgruntled with amusing people
he had boldly essayed the role
of Hamlet.</p>

<p>"Well," I remarked, encouragingly,
"I suppose the audience
called you to come out
before the curtain?"</p>

<p>"Called me," he said, soberly, "why, they just
dared me!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<p>Then there was Signor Tossi, the wonderful diver,
who for a stipend plunged from an elevated platform
into a tank of water.</p>

<p>"See here," I said to him boldly one day, "the
danger about this drop isn't much&mdash;how have you
got the nerve to call it a leap for life?"</p>

<p>"Why, don't I make my living by it? See?"</p>

<p>I guess he was right, don't you?</p>

<p>You can just believe a Coney Island audience
doesn't fancy being held up or swindled. But they
put up with a good deal of it just the same.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 328px;">
<a href="images/i011large.jpg"><img src="images/i011.jpg" width="328" height="400" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>Nor do they have any
patience with delays.</p>

<p>Things must hustle right
along down there to be
popular.</p>

<p>Once this same actor
tried to give a scene from
Othello, where the filmy
handkerchief plays such a
part as evidence of Desdemona's amours.</p>

<p>You remember Iago sets up the game on his
friend and talks about</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Trifles light as air<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are, to the jealous mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Confirmations strong as proofs of Holy Writ."<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>
<p>Othello demands the handkerchief be produced,
and repeats this several times in order to make it
more effective.</p>

<p>The audience, or some of them at least, failed to
appreciate this repetition, and grew decidedly restless.</p>

<p>At last, when for the third time Othello called for
the handkerchief, somebody yelled out.</p>

<p>"Wipe yer nose on yer slaive, ye naygur, and let
the play prosade."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="images/i012large.jpg"><img src="images/i012.jpg" width="400" height="382" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>Of course you all
know that of late years
a certain class of
women have taken to
enjoying man's attire.</p>

<p>Personally I don't
like it.</p>

<p>There are some who do.</p>

<p>When I mentioned my prejudice to
Bob Corwin only the other day he fairly jumped
on me.</p>

<p>"Disapprove of it!" he said, "Great Scott, no! I
wouldn't have it different for the world. Why, it was
as good as a circus this morning to watch and listen
to my wife when her collar button rolled under the
dresser."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="images/i013large.jpg"><img src="images/i013.jpg" width="400" height="367" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>It was this same good little
wife of Bob's who made something
of a mistake a while
back.</p>

<p>They had a pretty maid
at their house, and perhaps
Bob, quite naturally,
let his eyes follow her a few times in an absent-minded
way.</p>

<p>Men frequently do that, you know&mdash;don't mean
anything wrong at all, and just simply&mdash;well, look.</p>

<p>Of course his better half noticed it.</p>

<p>Now, she was no more jealous than the majority
of her sex, but somehow she foolishly began to suspect
that he was in the habit of kissing the girl in
the kitchen and was determined to catch him in
the act.</p>

<p>One Saturday night she saw him pass quietly into
the kitchen.</p>

<p>The hired girl was out, and the kitchen dark.</p>

<p>The jealous wife took a few matches in her hand,
and, hastily placing a shawl over her head, as the
hired girl often did, entered the back door.</p>

<p>Immediately she was seized and kissed and embraced
in an ardent manner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 352px;">
<a href="images/i014large.jpg"><img src="images/i014.jpg" width="352" height="400" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>With heart almost
bursting, the wife prepared
to administer a
terrible rebuke to the
faithless spouse.</p>

<p>Tearing herself away
from his fond embrace,
she struck a match
and stood face to face with Patrick, the
hired man.</p>

<p>My colored barber takes an affectionate interest
in my personal appearance.</p>

<p>No doubt he knows how much depends on my
presenting a handsome front while on the stage.</p>

<p>"Youh hair 'pears to be fallin' out, boss," he remarked,
yesterday, while trimming my locks, "I
reckons I kin save it.'"</p>

<p>"All right," I said, promptly, "save it if you want
to. I've got no use for it."</p>

<p>Perhaps he makes sofa cushions for the trade.</p>

<p>"I hear your name was proposed as a member of
the Bon Ton Colored Artists' Club. Did you get in?"
I asked him later on.</p>

<p>"Not dat time, boss. You see, dey white-balled
me," he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p>Adolphus has a streak of humor
in him.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 301px;">
<a href="images/i015large.jpg"><img src="images/i015.jpg" width="301" height="400" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>He is particularly sensitive to the
comic-paper jokes connected with a
darky's love for chickens and watermelons.</p>

<p>As the years roll on those chestnuts never seem
to die.</p>

<p>The barber grew so touchy that he hated the sight
of fowls, and even refused to eat eggs.</p>

<p>One day his next door neighbor in Jersey City
looked over the wall dividing their places.</p>

<p>"Seem to be busy, Adolphus&mdash;what you doing?"</p>

<p>"Jest plantin' some of my seeds, dat's all," remarked
Adolphus.</p>

<p>"H'm, thought it looked like you was planting one
of my hens."</p>

<p>"Dat's all right, Mr. Johnsing&mdash;de seed am inside,"
said Adolphus.</p>

<p>Adolphus was telling me recently about the poor
success a book agent had with his wife.</p>

<p>He was selling a "Mother's Guide."</p>

<p>"With the aid of this indispensable book," he declared,
"you will be able to bring up your children
properly."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="images/i016large.jpg"><img src="images/i016.jpg" width="400" height="388" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>Mrs. Adolphus took
the book and weighed
it thoughtfully in her
hand.</p>

<p>Then she caught
it by the edge and
brought it down on
the palm of her hand,
as if to see if it could be handled
with ease and dexterity.</p>

<p>"I reckon I don't want it," she announced, "becase,
as a fact, I don't see dat it's any bettah dan a
slippah."</p>

<p>That's going back to first principles.</p>

<p>And you know as well as I do, that some of our
best men were brought up that way.</p>

<p>There is nothing I enjoy better than the rattle of
a political campaign.</p>

<p>Take such a hurly-burly time as we had when
Jerome was running in New York for district attorney
on the reform ticket.</p>

<p>Sometimes they call on me to make a speech, and
if given enough time ahead in which to prepare, I get
along all right.</p>

<p>Once, however, I was caught napping.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p>I had been given to understand that my name
would be called last, and settled down to pick up
some points from the other fellow's remarks, on
which I could build. 'Tis an old trick.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 262px;">
<a href="images/i017large.jpg"><img src="images/i017.jpg" width="262" height="400" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>Through some mistake my name
was called second, and before I could
fully collect my wits, I found myself
there on the platform bowing
to the applause.</p>

<p>"There seems to be some
misunderstanding about my
being called so early in the proceedings,"
I remarked, "and the
incident puts me in mind of something
that once happened in my
native town.</p>

<p>"At the death of an eccentric citizen it was
learned that he had himself written his epitaph.</p>

<p>"When the lettering on the stone was completed,
we all went to see what our fellow-citizen had to
say of himself, and this was what we read under his
name and date of death:</p>

<p>"'I expected this, but not so soon.'"</p>

<p>That excused me. They didn't want any more
speeches from me. They thought it was an insinuation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
that our candidate would soon be a
dead one.</p>

<p>And while I'm on the subject of politics I want to
tell you of a little scene that I always look back on
with a grin.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 355px;">
<a href="images/i018large.jpg"><img src="images/i018.jpg" width="355" height="400" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>I happened to be in one of
those happy Western towns
during the heat of a campaign
where they serve out cocktails
and revolvers to all
comers.</p>

<p>The governor was a candidate
for re-election, and being a hustler,
made many hot speeches from the hustings.</p>

<p>Some of the opposition had gathered in front of
the hall, and with the idea of making him nervous,
interrupted every little
while just when he was
waxing eloquent.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 396px;">
<a href="images/i019large.jpg"><img src="images/i019.jpg" width="396" height="400" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>One very homely-looking
man insisted on
asking a question about
every five minutes.</p>

<p>He usually prefaced
them by such remarks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
as "Just a minute, please," or "Let me interrupt for
a minute."</p>

<p>Finally, in an unhappy moment, he broke in with:</p>

<p>"Pardon me, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Before he could finish, the governor, quickly seizing
his long-awaited opportunity, replied:</p>

<p>"Well, I've pardoned worse looking fellows than
you in my time, and I suppose it would be unjust to
draw the line now."</p>

<p>You bet there were no more interruptions after
that.</p>

<p>Some of you know Claude de Forrest, the actor.</p>

<p>He occasionally finds an engagement, but never
twice with the same manager.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 255px;">
<a href="images/i020large.jpg"><img src="images/i020.jpg" width="255" height="400" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>And yet Claude has his good
points, and can do some stunts
in his line.</p>

<p>Last winter he was playing at
the same house where I had an
engagement.</p>

<p>As the hero of the play he had
just died a glorious stage death.</p>

<p>Loud and long the audience
applauded.</p>

<p>At last he appeared before
the curtain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ladies and gentlemen," he said, "as you insist on
having a man who died a few minutes ago come to
life and appear before you with a bow and a smile,
I am here to comply with your wish.</p>

<p>"By way of destroying the illusion still further I
will, with your permission, occupy the time while the
stage is being made ready for the next act by reciting
'Hooligan at the Bat.'"</p>

<p>Which he proceeded to do.</p>

<p>And I fancy those misguided people soon wished
they had not resurrected him so soon.</p>

<p>When you manage to run across an original man it
pays to cultivate his acquaintance.</p>

<p>Hobbyhead has been a gold mine to me.</p>

<p>Whenever I have an attack of the blues I just
hunt him up, and ten to one forget all my troubles.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 375px;">
<a href="images/i021large.jpg"><img src="images/i021.jpg" width="375" height="400" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>A few more of his
sort would make a
stampede among the
physicians out our way.</p>

<p>To tell the truth,
every humorist knocks
out a dozen doctors.</p>

<p>We were chatting
the other day about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
things sacred and profane, when I chanced in the
course of some remarks to mention that when Gabriel
blew his horn on the final resurrection morn a good
many persons would be surprised at the company
they kept.</p>

<p>"Humph," grunted Hobbyhead, "don't you believe
that our friend Gabriel will be the only trumpet
sounder at the grand round-up."</p>

<p>"Why don't you think he won't?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Because every self-made man will insist on blowing
his own horn."</p>

<p>While we were taking a walk through the country
we met a farmer driving a fine bull in to market.</p>

<p>Both of us commented on the fact that it had a
scrubby tail, and when Hobbyhead insisted on addressing
the man I knew he had conceived a bright
thought.</p>

<p>"I suppose, my friend, you'll have to sell that
beast wholesale," he said.</p>

<p>The owner came from his reverie.</p>

<p>"What fer?"</p>

<p>"Well," assured my solemn friend, nodding his head
toward the scrubby tuft of hair, and pursing his lips,
"well, you see you cant have him re-tailed."</p>

<p>But occasionally Hobbyhead finds himself tripped
up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>The pitcher may go to the well once too often.</p>

<p>I saw the deed done recently, and you ought to
have been there to watch the humorist turn green
with envy.</p>

<p>He was having some additions made to his country
house, and had occasion to hire a tramp carpenter.</p>

<p>Somehow he was suspicious of the man's ability,
and proceeded to put him through a course of
sprouts.</p>

<p>"See here, my friend, do you know all about carpenter
work?" he asked.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="images/i022large.jpg"><img src="images/i022.jpg" width="400" height="364" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>"Yes, sir," was the reply.</p>

<p>"You can make windows,
doors and blinds?"</p>

<p>"Why, certain, sir."</p>

<p>"How would you make a
Venetian blind?"</p>

<p>The man considered
steadily for several
minutes.</p>

<p>"I think," he remarked finally, with a grin, "that I
would punch him in the eye."</p>

<p>He was engaged as soon as John recovered his
breath.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p>Such sharp-edged tools are rare among journeymen
carpenters, and I've suspected Hobbyhead
meant to utilize the fellow in order to brighten his
own wits.</p>

<p>Hobbyhead's smallest boy came home from the
Barnum show the other evening.</p>

<p>It was his first outing of the sort, and he was
bursting with the knowledge of the wonders he
had seen.</p>

<p>His parental guardian, of course, questioned him
regarding the stupendous aggregation, and soon discovered
that among the many astonishing gymnasts
little Jack had been especially attracted toward the
wizard who ties himself up into a bunch of knots.</p>

<p>"I'm going to be a contortionist when I grow up,"
he proudly announced, "and right away to-morrow
you'll see me start in trainin'."</p>

<p>"All right," said the interested parent; "it's a glorious
career, my son, and to show you how much I
appreciate your ambition I shall
order half a bushel of green apples
to be sent around. They'll
give you a good start."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="images/i023large.jpg"><img src="images/i023.jpg" width="400" height="279" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>Hobbyhead claims
that he gets many of
his tidiest puns from this young hopeful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p>For instance, when little Jack was studying his
book one evening he called his father's attention to
a fact which he was sturdily prepared to dispute.</p>

<p>"Say, pa, this book says nature never wastes anything."</p>

<p>"I guess that's right, my son," replied the father,
thoughtlessly.</p>

<p>"Then what's the use of a cow having two horns
when she can't even play on one," asked Jack, triumphantly.</p>

<p>Hobbyhead's genius failed him in the emergency.</p>

<p>When Hobbyhead was taking a holiday down at
Long Branch, with his family, the price he had to pay
rather congealed his blood.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 317px;">
<a href="images/i024large.jpg"><img src="images/i024.jpg" width="317" height="400" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>Some of the descendants of Captain
Kidd must have settled there and
grown up with the country.</p>

<p>At any rate they bleed a
man just as thoroughly as
in the palmy days of Blackbeard
and his corsair crew.</p>

<p>Hobbyhead had intended
spending two weeks at the
shore, but when he scanned
his bill he found he would have just about money
enough left to pay fares home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p>And he considered there must have been some
mistake about it to leave him even that.</p>

<p>While he was feeling sore and disgruntled, he
chanced to fall into conversation with the proprietor.</p>

<p>This gentleman complained that the rats gave
them considerable trouble, and that he would pay
considerable to be rid of the gnawing rodents.</p>

<p>"I can tell you an infallible cure, sir," said Hobbyhead.</p>

<p>"I should be deeply obliged to you," returned the
landlord.</p>

<p>"Well, then, once a week make out your bill and
charge the rats as you've charged me, and I'll be
hanged if the rats ever come to your house again,"
said Hobbyhead.</p>

<p>Would you believe it, that landlord was hurt.</p>

<p>Some people never can take a joke.</p>

<p>Recently I came across a young fellow employed
on a daily paper, and whom I have known some time.</p>

<p>As a usual thing he was a happy-go-lucky, cheerful
chap, and I was surprised to see the dejected
look on his face.</p>

<p>Remember, too, he had been only recently married,
and to a charming girl, at that.</p>

<p>I immediately experienced some curiosity to know
what had upset him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hello, old chap!" I said. "You look glum. Nothing
happened, eh? Not fired?"</p>

<p>"No; job's all right. I'm worried&mdash;that all," he replied.</p>

<p>"What's the trouble?"</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 368px;">
<a href="images/i025large.jpg"><img src="images/i025.jpg" width="368" height="400" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>"Well, I'll tell you.
Fact is, I've got a seal-skin
wife and a muskrat
salary."</p>

<p>Then I laughed.</p>

<p>"Don't let that worry
you, old man! Most of
us fellows are in the
same predicament. It's the same old
story, so common&mdash;a champagne appetite and a
lager beer pocketbook. Get used to it in time, so
cheer up. Let's liquidate."</p>

<p>Perhaps you may never have suspected that I was
one of the heroes who stormed San Juan Hill.</p>

<p>Only for me and Teddy there might have been a
different story to tell of that great day.</p>

<p>I seldom mention the fact, being constitutionally
bashful.</p>

<p>And, besides, it pleases me to see all the glory go
to the man who leads such a strenuous life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p>But, honest Injun, I was there
where the Spanish Mausers were
cracking merrily, and
I wouldn't like to tell
you how much foreign
lead I took that
day.</p>

<p>Perhaps you may
remember that at one time
matters got so hot that there was considerable consternation
among our bold boys in blue.</p>

<p>One fellow, who was evidently getting his baptism
in fire, had stood it for a time, though his knees must
have been knocking together some.</p>

<p>It became necessary to retreat temporarily, while
the bullets sang around like mad hornets; but once
started for the rear this fellow's legs actually ran
away with him.</p>

<p>He plunged along like a rhinoceros, utterly regardless.</p>

<p>An officer bellowed after him.</p>

<p>"Here, you, what are you running for?"</p>

<p>I saw the scared New Englander turn his head
and throw over his shoulder:</p>

<p>"Because I can't fly, you darned fool!"</p>

<p>Hello, there, what was that&mdash;actually a mosquito
trying to nip me, the bloodsucker!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p>Come to think of it, skeeters are about the slickest
nuisances we've got.</p>

<p>Have you ever thought what sly coons they are,
and how they maneuvre to get their suction pump at
work, just as if they had learned army tactics?</p>

<p>Say, ever been down in Jacksonville when the mercury's
so high you can't breathe and the skeeters are
humming their monotonous anthem? This is the
song they sing:</p>

<p>Aha! There's my friend Judge Longears in the
back row. Now, don't everybody rubber. Well,
well, well, he's scooted. I pity these bashful men.
Judge Longears has in his day
defended all manner
of criminals.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 400px;">

<p>Some of them escaped
punishment
Which they richly deserved,
simply because
they were wise enough
to employ a smart
lawyer.</p>

<p>And no doubt the fee he received often constituted
the proceeds of the very robbery of which
they had just been proven innocent.</p>

<p>Even in his early career I remember he had an
experience of this character.</p>

<p>In my hearing his good wife said to him:</p>

<p>"So you cleared that poor Mr. Liftem from the
charge of stealing that turkey? I'm glad of it, but
he's such a worthless character that I don't believe
you'll ever get a cent for your services."</p>

<p>I have never forgotten the smile that stole over
the placid face of Longears, as he replied:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<p>"Perhaps not, Maria, but I've got an all-fired good
turkey out in the woodshed, just the same."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="images/i030large.jpg"><img src="images/i030.jpg" width="400" height="380" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>But I tell you Longears was a terror in his young
days. I've seen him
bullyrag a poor devil
in the box until he
caused him to say
just what he wanted.</p>

<p>There are some
men, however, who
are the quintessence of
meekness.</p>

<p>I knew one whose gardener used to crib and sell
his fruit and vegetables, and had to be dismissed.</p>

<p>For the sake of his wife and family he gave him a
letter of recommendation, which ran about like this:</p>

<p>"I hereby certify that Thomas Buck has been my
gardener for over two years, and that during that
time he got more out of my garden than any other
man I ever employed."</p>

<p>I saw two disreputable citizens meet the other
day, and judged they had not run across each other
for a long spell of Sundays.</p>

<p>"Hullo, Hans, how's the wurrld threatin' ye?" demanded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
the one who bore the
map of Ireland on his face.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 257px;">
<a href="images/i031large.jpg"><img src="images/i031.jpg" width="257" height="400" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>"I do not gomplain somethings
mabbe. Such vindy
veather is goot for my professions
quite," replied the
German.</p>

<p>"Be jabers, it's getting up
in the wurrld ye must be.
'Pon yer 'onor now, phat do
yees do to make a living?"</p>

<p>"I examine ribs."</p>

<p>"And I break the same; but phat joke is it ye're
afther giving me to say yer a surgeon?"</p>

<p>"You should not so quick joomp at conclusions&mdash;I
am an umbrella mender."</p>

<p>"On me own part, it's no need I hav to wurrk at
all, since discoverin' that I belonged to a swell
family."</p>

<p>"You don't say!"</p>

<p>"And that wun av me ancestors was a minute
man."</p>

<p>"Ish it possible&mdash;tell me how that might come?"</p>

<p>"Why, don't ye see, ye omadhaun, didn't that same
mimber av the family wurrk on Sixty-second Street?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p>Then the rattle of an elevated train drowned the
rest.</p>

<p>I felt that I had lost five dollars by not hearing
how Hans got back again.</p>

<p>Sometimes when the Sunday morning bells calling
to church jangle from various spires, I think of the
well-known old poem on the subject of their music;
and then my mind goes out to other belles, to be seen
parading in their best gowns, ready to break the
hearts of admiring mankind.</p>

<p>And talking about women makes you think of
song. Wine, women and song, you know. We'll
cut out the wine and have the song. Here she goes:</p>

<p>I spent a week or two with a friend in the suburbs
last spring.</p>

<p>He had one little chap that greatly interested me.</p>

<p>He reminded me of what I must have been, for he
was eternally in a peck of trouble.</p>

<p>Liked candy, too, and when I found
that he no longer hooked lumps of sugar
out of the bowl on the table, I
became convinced that his
cure must have been radical.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 326px;">
<a href="images/i034large.jpg"><img src="images/i034.jpg" width="326" height="400" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>So I made an investigation.</p>

<p>The woodshed figured largely in
the matter, too.</p>

<p>That brought back other tender recollections, for,
do you know, we once had a woodshed.</p>

<p>Favorite place for an affectionate interview between
father and son.</p>

<p>I never go past one without feeling hurt.</p>

<p>Frederick was inclined to be confidential, and
readily admitted that his mother's solicitude concerning
his state of health, and the possibility of
his contracting a crop of worms from too steady
a sugar diet had prompted her to a little exercise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 282px;">
<a href="images/i035large.jpg"><img src="images/i035.jpg" width="282" height="400" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>"She laid it on just like I
was a little pig," he complained.</p>

<p>I saw the connection immediately.</p>

<p>"Just so," I said, "a ham,
sugar-cured."</p>

<p>Bijinks buttonholed me on
the way here, and I could see
from his face that he was
laying for me.</p>

<p>I've given him numerous falls from time to time, and
he swore to get even.</p>

<p>I think he must have sat up nights, and just from
curiosity I'd like to compare his gas bill with that of
last month.</p>

<p>Good jokes come high, I tell you, and I'm really
afraid poor old Bijinks will never be the same man
he was before.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 356px;">
<a href="images/i036large.jpg"><img src="images/i036.jpg" width="356" height="400" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>Success has made his hat
seem too small, and presently
I'll hear of him applying for my
job.</p>

<p>But about the thing he
tossed me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<p>Purposely he introduced the subject of the
navy.</p>

<p>"Talking of ships," he said, soberly, "I suppose
courtship might properly be considered a transport."</p>

<p>I told him that it was cruel to take advantage of
me.</p>

<p>"But, sometimes," he continued, mercilessly, "it is
nothing more nor less than a sort of wor&mdash;ship."</p>

<p>Then he artfully began to tell what wonders he
had seen over in London during the time Edward
was crowned king.</p>

<p>"Say, a coronation must be a dreadfully expensive
affair," I chanced to remark, and how his eyes glittered
as he drove it home, for the expected opening
had come.</p>

<p>"Well, rather; why, the dentist charged me ten
dollars just for crowning a single tooth."</p>

<p>That was also on me.</p>

<p>But Bijinks gets hold of some pretty good stories
occasionally, and I expect he'll soon be working them
off along with hoary chestnuts that have done duty
for ages.</p>

<p>One I know bears the marks of newness, since
the game of ping pong has only recently come into
existence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<p>He says he knew the old fellow that said it, but I
rather think he prevaricates, and must have discovered
the joke in some obscure country paper.</p>

<p>It was in Texas it happened.</p>

<p>An old farmer had a girl attending school at Fort
Worth, and in course of a letter home to the old
folks chanced to say "I'm just in love with ping
pong."</p>

<p>Whereupon up rose the Texan farmer in wrath
and laid down the law in unmistakeable terms.</p>

<p>You see he had been to Fort Worth and even had
his biled shirt done up at a Celestial laundry.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="images/i037large.jpg"><img src="images/i037.jpg" width="400" height="400" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>"Here, mother," says he, bringing
down his horny fist on
the table till the dishes
danced. "You jest write
and tell Amarillis Jane that
if she's goin' to fall in love
with any of them blamed
Fort Worth Chinamen, she
can just count on bein' cut off without a cent."</p>

<p>Bijinks puts up a bluff about having fought in the
Spanish-American war. He was enrolled but he
never fought. Fact is, he got discharged for a breach
of etiquette. Yes, you see he turned his back to the
enemy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<p>Do any of you people play golf? My advice is
"Don't!" But what's the use of talking?</p>

<p>The fascination of golf has much to answer for.</p>

<p>At the same time one would hardly expect it to
upset the calculations of a minister.</p>

<p>That's just what happened when I was in old
Scotland, taking in their raw atmosphere, and a few
other things besides.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="images/i038large.jpg"><img src="images/i038.jpg" width="400" height="358" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>I often watched the reverend
gentleman play, and saw how
infatuated he had become
with the game.</p>

<p>Yet he labored under a great
handicap.</p>

<p>When he missed the ball,
and performed a wonderful series of gyrations, it
must have been very hard to compress his agitated
feelings in such a narrow compass as:</p>

<p>"Tut, tut," or, "Well, well," perhaps "Oh, dear, now."</p>

<p>More robust language alone meets the emergency.</p>

<p>The last I saw of him was when he had striven
with unusual fervor to knock the ball from the tee,
and his face shone with exertion and indignation.</p>

<p>"Dear, dear, but I'll hae to gie it up&mdash;I'll hae to
gie it up," he said in despair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

<p>"Give up playing golf&mdash;that's too bad," I remarked,
whereupon he hastily turned upon me and said:</p>

<p>"Na, na, gie up the meenistry."</p>

<p>Feeling in high spirits when I entered my favorite restaurant
yesterday, I asked the proprietor at the desk:</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 360px;">
<a href="images/i039large.jpg"><img src="images/i039.jpg" width="360" height="400" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>"Do you serve lobsters
here?"</p>

<p>"Why, of course we
do&mdash;have a seat. Now,
what'll you have," was the
reply.</p>

<p>That man knew me for
sure.</p>

<p>The girl who waited on
me began to rattle off a list of dishes which were on
the menu.</p>

<p>Perhaps I was partly to blame, since I had asked:</p>

<p>"Well, Mame, what have you got to-day?"</p>

<p>"Pretty nearly everything, sir&mdash;I've got calves'
brains, frogs' legs, chicken liver&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hold on," I said.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Nothing, only you ought to see a doctor."</p>

<p>Did you ever notice what singular names many of
the Rhode Island towns and cities have, as well as
those in the wooden nutmeg State.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<p>Now, there's old Nantucket, for instance, once the
most noted whaling center of America.</p>

<p>That place always fascinates me; makes me burst
into song, as it were.</p>

<p>Let's have a bar, professor.</p>

<p>Well, I fancy that is quite sufficient for one
time.</p>

<p>Talking about names, I had often wondered why
Maine has so long been a prohibition State, until recently
when glancing over the map the truth flashed
upon me.</p>

<p>Surely no drunken man could ever pronounce such
jaw breakers as Umbazooksus and Mattawamkeag.</p>

<p>I went with Jack Rackstraw looking for board the
other day.</p>

<p>Ever try it?</p>

<p>Funniest game going.</p>

<p>Talk about studying human nature, why nothing
equals what you run across in boarding houses.</p>

<p>There was one vinegary old maid to whom he applied
who gave me a cold chill.</p>

<p>She was so thin, that for the life of me I couldn't
help thinking of the living skeleton who lost his balance
while washing at the sink, and had to be pulled
out of the waste pipe.</p>

<p>Rackstraw allowed himself to be questioned
meekly enough.</p>

<p>Soon she knew more about his business and his
remote ancestors than I did, and I had been his
friend twice ten years.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

<p>At last she stormed the fort.</p>

<p>I saw blood in her eye, and knew what was on
tap from the way her thin lips came together.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 263px;">
<a href="images/i041large.jpg"><img src="images/i041.jpg" width="263" height="400" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>"You say you are married?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes."</p>

<p>"Ah! any family, Mr. Rackstraw?"</p>

<p>"One baby," he stammered,
"would you mind that?"</p>

<p>"Mind it," she snapped,
"what do you take me for&mdash;a
nurse?"</p>

<p>Rackstraw didn't board
there, I remark in passing.</p>

<p>Well, if you'd ever been a country school teacher,
perhaps you wouldn't growl at things because they
didn't come your way.</p>

<p>I went visiting while up in the Catskills, and before
the school season was over.</p>

<p>The teacher lived at a small hotel, and of course
didn't appreciate the trials of family housekeeping,
but on that particular day I can tell you she got a
pretty decent insight into the tribulations of those
who have to live that way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<p>A little girl came in
late.</p>

<p>"See here, Sarah, you
are five minutes behind
time. Yesterday it was
three minutes. Explain!"
she said.</p>

<p>But Sarah didn't scare
worth a cent.</p>

<p>She broke loose like a
steam-engine and fairly paralysed us both; and it
was something like this:</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 389px;">
<a href="images/i043large.jpg"><img src="images/i043.jpg" width="389" height="400" alt="" /></a>

<p>"Please, ma'am, the alarm-clock stopped last
night, and it was so dark and foggy this morning that
the girl didn't wake until late, and then, trying to get
to the kitchen window in the
dark, she upset some water
on the kindling wood;
it was the water the
mackerel was soaking
in, and it was on a
chair, and the wood
was under it, and then because
the wood was wet the fire
wouldn't burn, and the other wood we ordered the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
day before hadn't come, and the neighbor next door
hadn't any either, and the girl had to go to the store
for some, and she was a good while getting there,
and then the storekeeper told her she needn't bring
it, 'cause he would send it right around before she
got back, and 'cause she didn't know him she believed
him; and when she got back the wood wasn't
there, and it was a long time before it came, and
then it was all wet from the fog and rain, 'cause he
didn't cover it up, and when we tried
to start the fire again it wouldn't
burn any better than the first time;
and then mamma hurried over to
our kind neighbor to get the use of
her stove, but they were getting
their breakfast and we
could only use one hole at a time, and our kettles
and pans wouldn't fit their stove, and we had to wait
till some of theirs was cleaned, and then mamma
tried to cook some oatmeal so I could hurry and get
to school, and then the baker didn't come, and the
girl had to go out for bread while I dressed Sally, and
Johnny, and Mamie, and then the baby woke and
began to cry hard, as if he was hurt, and mamma
hurried upstairs to see what was the matter, and
while she was finding out the oatmeal burned, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
we had to wait till the kettle could be cleaned and
some more cooked, and when that was done I hurried
and ate a little so I wouldn't be late to school, and
I had just time to get here, but Johnny got the nose-bleed
awful, and I had to wait until mamma could
get through with him and wash her hands so she
could write me an excuse for bein' late yesterday."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 400px;">

<p>When the teacher could catch her breath, she
said:</p>

<p>"Excused. Take your seat."</p>

<p>I struck a lawyer chum in the cars the other day
and thought I'd interest him by talking shop.</p>

<p>"I hear old Judge Pennytobacco is breaking up
housekeeping," I said.</p>

<p>"That's strange&mdash;I hardly believe that can be
true. The judge is working night and day, simply
overwhelmed with cases. He has no time to think
of such a thing."</p>

<p>"What kind of cases?"</p>

<p>"Er&mdash;divorce cases, principally."</p>

<p>"That's it," I said.</p>

<p>"Oh!" He thought it over for a minute, then
changed the conversation by remarking: "By the way,
I hear you've taken to writing verses."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<p>"Experimenting a little, that's all."</p>

<p>"Have you submitted
any to the
editor?"</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="images/i045large.jpg"><img src="images/i045.jpg" width="400" height="320" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>"Yes, a few."</p>

<p>"And did the editor
kick at the verses?"</p>

<p>"Well, he kicked all
right, but not at the verses exactly. Here's one
of 'em:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"He harped upon her beauty, he harped upon her grace,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But she answered his proposal with a coldly cruel 'Never!'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So he took a dose of poison and proceeded to a place<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Where, I venture the assertion, he will harp no more forever."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"This is where I get off," remarked my legal friend
coldly.</p>

<p>"So do I," I cried, jumping up. "Let's take a turn
round together."</p>

<p>As we sallied along we passed a meat market,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
the proprietor of which was
standing in the doorway.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 308px;">
<a href="images/i046large.jpg"><img src="images/i046.jpg" width="308" height="400" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>He greeted us with a
pleasant nod and a good-humored
"You're looking
well, sir."</p>

<p>"There's a fellow for you,"
I said. "He seems to increase
in girth every month.
I knew him when he tipped the scales at a hundred
and thirty. Perhaps you wouldn't believe it&mdash;and
what do you think he weighs now?"</p>

<p>"Well, what does he weigh?" asked my legal
friend.</p>

<p>"Meat."</p>

<p>Fortunately at that moment my friend was stopped
by an angry client.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 397px;">
<a href="images/i047large.jpg"><img src="images/i047.jpg" width="397" height="400" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>Somehow this irate gentleman seemed to think he
had gotten hold of the hot
end of a deal.</p>

<p>And sputtering with rage
he didn't hesitate to call a
spade by its proper name.</p>

<p>"I see the scoundrel in
your face!" exclaimed the
angry man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>

<p>"That," replied the man of law, calmly, "I consider
a personal reflection."</p>

<p>Then he sauntered on with me, and when the
other found time to figure out things more fully, I
guess he was madder than ever, don't you?</p>

<p>Smart chap, that lawyer! Sometimes he works
so upon the feelings of the jury that he gets his
man off.</p>

<p>And then again a case will arise that in spite of
his eloquence goes against him.</p>

<p>He made a miss with Sikes, and I'm thinking that
fellow will meet his end shortly.</p>

<p>This is in Jersey, where they still hang men, you
know.</p>

<p>I went along to see
the man, for somehow
I'd never set eyes on a
condemned criminal, and
rather thought it might
round out an experience.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 288px;">
<a href="images/i048large.jpg"><img src="images/i048.jpg" width="288" height="400" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>Sikes was a hard-looking
citizen.</p>

<p>I fear if I had been
the judge, his face alone
would have sent him to
the gallows.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<p>And yet he mellowed some and even laughed.</p>

<p>A prison visitor was wrestling with him, no doubt
meaning well, but not having much effect on so hard
a case.</p>

<p>She tried to make his mind revert to his childhood,
when he said his prayers at his mother's knee, and
all that sort of thing, you know.</p>

<p>"My poor fellow," I heard her say, "when you contemplate
your approaching doom, does not your
memory revert longingly to those innocent days, and
would you not enjoy once more those childish sports
of the long ago?"</p>

<p>"Well," said Sikes, reflecting, as though his mind
had indeed traveled far back into the dim past, "sure,
there's one thing I'd like mighty well to do, and that
is skip the rope."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="images/i049large.jpg"><img src="images/i049.jpg" width="400" height="400" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>My legal friend
really made a
powerful plea in
the Sikes case,
and I thought he
would win out.</p>

<p>But there must
have been one jury-man
for conviction,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
who finally brought the other eleven obstinate men
to his way of thinking.</p>

<p>Why, I actually felt the tears in my eyes and the
accused began to look like an angel, whereas a short
time before I had thought him a ruffian.</p>

<p>The lawyer's boy was present too, and when he
went home he gave a report of the proceedings.</p>

<p>I had it straight from headquarters.</p>

<p>"It was a dandy speech, mamma&mdash;why he 'most
cried himself, the prisoner wiped his eyes, some
ladies had to be taken out of the room so the trial
could go on, and I guess the jury felt powerfully bad
too," he said.</p>

<p>"And how about you, son," inquired his pleased
mother.</p>

<p>The little fellow cocked his eye and smiled.</p>

<p>"Oh! he can't fool
me," he said.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 355px;">

</div>

<p>While waiting one day
in court for the case, in
which I was a witness,
to be called, they led a
tough-looking citizen into
the pen.</p>

<p>He was a typical
burglar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<p>Why the burgle stood out all over him in lumps.</p>

<p>When I looked at him I thought how much I had
to be thankful for that I didn't have to meet him
under other distressing circumstances of a dark
night.</p>

<p>In fact I figured that I was in just thirty cents.</p>

<p>Well, he was the last fellow you'd ever suspect
of having a streak of humor in his make-up.</p>

<p>He objected to being called a thief.</p>

<p>"I've a trade, your honor."</p>

</div>

<p>"What is it?" demanded
the judge.</p>

<p>"Locksmith."</p>

<p>"Just so; and what
were you doing in the
bank when the policemen
took you?"</p>

<p>"Making a bolt for
the door, sure."</p>

<p>But his jesting mood
did not save him, and he was given another kind of
job for a time.</p>

<p>When Rube comes to town there is a lot of fun
poked at the rustic, and even gold bricks slipped into
his pockets in exchange for the coveted long green.</p>

<p>And no doubt some of you
good people know from experience
that when a city
man migrates to the
country the farmers
delight to expose
his ignorance of
things generally. I had
an experience of that sort last
summer when I engaged board
for my little outfit at Farmer Wilkins'.</p>

<p>We arrived late in the evening and retired to our
shuck mattresses very soon, being tired from the
journey; so the tiller of the soil didn't have much of
a chance to make my acquaintance.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 392px;">
<a href="images/i053large.jpg"><img src="images/i053.jpg" width="392" height="400" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>Early in the morning
I was abroad, and
ran across Wilkins
and his hired man
milking the cows.</p>

<p>"Mornin'," said he,
"come to find out
whichever keow
gives the buttermilk,
or p'r'aps ye thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
to be airly enough to hear the haycock crow?" and
he tipped a wink at his man, who was enjoying the
fun.</p>

<p>"Well, neither, to tell the truth, Mr. Wilkins," I remarked,
"I've just been out tying a knot in a cord of
wood."</p>

<p>Wilkins, among his other possessions, owned an
uncommonly homely dog which was a source of considerable
interest to my youngest.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="images/i054large.jpg"><img src="images/i054.jpg" width="400" height="348" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>You see we were never the proud
owners of even a brindle
cur, and of course Harold
made friends with Rover
from the very start.</p>

<p>Whenever the beast
wanted to play he would whirl
around in a circle, chasing his own tail in a comical
manner that never failed to make us laugh.</p>

<p>That humorous tale would have been worth a
small fortune if properly brought to the attention of
the editor of the Sunday paper comic section.</p>

<p>Harold had stood and looked at the revolving
beast nearly ten minutes, urging him on with sundry
shouts.</p>

<p>Then he turned to me.</p>

<p>"What kind of a dog is that, pa?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<p>I'm no connoisseur of dogs, and was never made
a judge in a bench show in my life.</p>

<p>I knew several breeds, but this nondescript was
really beyond my ken.</p>

<p>At the same time it's never good policy to confess
ignorance when asked a point-blank question
by Young America.</p>

<p>"Oh," I said casually, "why, he's a&mdash;yes, a watch
dog, Harold."</p>

<p>The boy pondered a minute, while the beast kept
revolving.</p>

<p>"Well," he observed, "from the long time it takes
him to wind himself up, I guess he must be a Waterbury
watch dog."</p>

<p>While on the way to the Grand Central Depot I
had to take the seat at the rear end of an open car.</p>

<p>Of course as you all know the last three or four
seats are generally reserved for men who must
smoke or die.</p>

<p>Occasionally, on account of the crowded condition
of the cars, a female or two finds herself tucked
away between the users of the weed.</p>

<p>Perhaps she is accustomed to it at home and
pays little attention to the puffs of pungent smoke
that float around her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="images/i055large.jpg"><img src="images/i055.jpg" width="400" height="381" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>I have seen cases,
however, where
the disgust was
written in big letters
on the lady's
face, and she
took the earliest
occasion to
change her
seat.</p>

<p>Such an instance occurred that day.</p>

<p>I thought she was a woman with considerable
temper, just from her looks, and when she spoke I
was sure of it.</p>

<p>"Smoking on a car!" she exclaimed, as an Irishman
with his short-stemmed pipe took his seat beside
her.</p>

<p>"Oi am!" rejoined Pat, between long and determined
puffs. "And av ye don't loike ut go wan up
froont. These sates is resairved for smokhers."</p>

<p>"If you were my husband I'd give you poison," she
snapped.</p>

<p>"Would ye, now?" Puff, puff. "Oi think av ye
wor me woife"&mdash;puff, puff&mdash;"Oi'd take ut."</p>

<p>Hotel clerks stand in a class by themselves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<p>I have great admiration for the whole tribe, and am
on speaking terms with quite a bunch.</p>

<p>But for pure nerve commend me to that chap&mdash;it
was in Chattanooga where I was stopping at the time&mdash;who
rung me up from the office, five stories down.</p>

<p>Time eleven thirty-seven at night.</p>

<p>I jumped out of bed, and turning on the electric
light, rushed to the phone.</p>

<p>"Hello, 411."</p>

<p>"Hello."</p>

<p>"This George Niblo?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Gone to bed, yet?"</p>

<p>"Sure. Do you think I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's all right. How're you feeling?"</p>

<p>"All right."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 337px;">
<a href="images/i056large.jpg"><img src="images/i056.jpg" width="337" height="400" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>"That's good.
Feel equal to a hurry-up
slide down the
fire-escape?"</p>

<p>"Well, I might if I
had to. Say&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"All right; that's
just how it stands.
You wriggle into
your clothes now,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
and make a record doing it. You see, the hotel's on
fire, and&mdash;and&mdash;gee! Don't talk like that, Brother
Niblo, there are ladies in the next room. Good-by."</p>

<p>You bet I made record time, and got out in pretty
decent order, considering that I carried all my
clothes on my arms.</p>

<p>I always believe that telephone saved my life,
though I never could quite forgive the impudence of
the clerk.</p>

<p>Among his other accomplishments Benson writes
fancy ads, and when I dropped in on him he was
hard at work getting up a unique booklet.</p>

<p>My curiosity forced me to examine the cover, and
I saw it was intended to puff the benefits to be derived
from using Madam Tussaud's Hair Restorer.</p>

<p>"Going to have stories between the covers?" I
asked.</p>

<p>"Sure."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="images/i057large.jpg"><img src="images/i057.jpg" width="400" height="394" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>"Oh, I can imagine
the kind&mdash;all about the
beautiful girl whose long
braid was cut off by a
rascal, and who found a
rich husband."</p>

<p>"You're away off," he
remarked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well then, how about the maiden who paid the
mortgage on the old home by sacrificing her wonderful
crop of hair, depending upon the use of this stuff
for a new supply&mdash;ain't that straight?"</p>

<p>"Humbug," he snorted.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 291px;">
<a href="images/i058large.jpg"><img src="images/i058.jpg" width="291" height="400" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>"Very well&mdash;tell me
what brand you expect to
use."</p>

<p>"Ghost stories, of
course."</p>

<p>"And why ghost
stories?"</p>

<p>"Well, I'm blessed, when
you know just as much as
I do they're the only genuine
hair-raising stuff."</p>

<p>On my way to the elevated I sometimes stop in
to leave an order at our grocer's.</p>

<p>Just this morning I found him taking an order from
a new customer, who, I judged, had not been married
very long.</p>

<p>Of course I couldn't help hearing some fragments
of their delightful conversation.</p>

<p>I have a higher opinion of that grocer now.</p>

<p>He must have served his time as a court interpreter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>

<p>"You might send me
a pound of paralysed
sugar," she said.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 386px;">
<a href="images/i059large.jpg"><img src="images/i059.jpg" width="386" height="400" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>"Yes'm. What else?"</p>

<p>"A couple of cans
of condemned milk."</p>

<p>"Yes'm."</p>

<p>"And a bag of fresh
salt&mdash;be sure it's quite
fresh."</p>

<p>"That's down, ma'am&mdash;anything more you can
think of?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes, you might send a pound of desecrated
codfish."</p>

<p>"Nothing more, ma'am&mdash;we have just received a
fresh lot of nice horseradish which I can recommend."</p>

<p>"Not to-day, thank you. We don't keep a horse."</p>

<p>When she went out that man filed the order without
even a smile upon his face.</p>

<p>I felt like fanning myself with a washboard, although
it was bitter cold outside.</p>

<p>While I was calling on Bob Sherlock, to talk over
a little business he and myself were interested in,
there was something of a commotion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<p>It began after
my arrival.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="images/i060large.jpg"><img src="images/i060.jpg" width="400" height="330" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>I sat in the parlor
waiting for Bob,
who was dressing.</p>

<p>The family were
in the back parlor,
there being several children
patterned very much after Bob.</p>

<p>Presently I heard signs of trouble.</p>

<p>Then Mrs. Bob said, a little sharply:</p>

<p>"Lawrence, don't be so selfish. Let your baby
brother play with your marbles a little while."</p>

<p>"But he means to keep them always," said a
voice.</p>

<p>"Oh, I guess not."</p>

<p>"I guess yes, 'cause he's swallowed three of 'em
already," said Lawrence,
with the positiveness of
conviction.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 367px;">
<a href="images/i061large.jpg"><img src="images/i061.jpg" width="367" height="400" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>Then the fun began.</p>

<p>But the baby was saved,
and I strongly suspect Lawrence
stretched matters
to suit his convenience.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<p>My family doctor ordered me to a warmer climate
last winter.</p>

<p>I told him I objected to going so soon.</p>

<p>However, we compromised matters by deciding
that North Carolina might do.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 338px;">
<a href="images/i062large.jpg"><img src="images/i062.jpg" width="338" height="400" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>Mountain air and Mountain Dew
have been known to work wonders
in combination.</p>

<p>Now, perhaps you remember
that Bill Nye
had a home down in the
Tar Heel State, and I
was glad to know I
would soon be breathing
the same pine woods' air.</p>

<p>While the wagon was taking me to the retired
home of the settler with whom I meant to camp out,
it stopped before a tumble-down cabin, where there
was a well of the finest water on earth.</p>

<p>A small boy handed up the gourd, while a girl with
a shock of carroty hair stood afar off and watched.</p>

<p>"What's your sister's name?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Her name?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;she's your sister, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Yep."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well what do you call her?"</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 331px;">
<a href="images/i063large.jpg"><img src="images/i063.jpg" width="331" height="400" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>"Lize&mdash;we uns call her
Uneasy Lize."</p>

<p>"That's strange. How
did she come by it?"</p>

<p>"To school. Teacher
told we uns to each git a
motter an' larn it, and come to
school an' say it; sister she learned 'Uneasy lies the
head that wears a crown,' but she got so scart
when she come to say it she never got no further'n
'Uneasy lies&mdash;&mdash;' an' that's the name she's gone by
ever since. Thankee, mister. Have another
drink?"</p>

<p>Say, did I tell you I met Judkins on the Elevated
the other morning. Judkins is the greatest bore in
the country. Take that from
me. Well, sirs, he started in
to tell me his family history.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 380px;">
<a href="images/i064large.jpg"><img src="images/i064.jpg" width="380" height="400" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>"You know my wife's sister
Gwendolyn!" he asked.</p>

<p>"From Boston&mdash;yes," I
murmured, prepared to grin
and bear it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, she don't understand why my youngest lad
condescends to associate with some boys toward
whom she has taken a cordial dislike on sight.</p>

<p>"Now, only this morning I heard her reproaching
him.</p>

<p>"'How can you associate
with that Bink's
boy? I understand he's
the worst scholar in the
school.'</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="images/i065large.jpg"><img src="images/i065.jpg" width="400" height="396" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>"'Huh!' said my little
chap, quick as a shot,
'don't you think I've got
any gratitude, aunty&mdash;why, if it wasn't for him, Harold
Bangs or me'd be at the foot of the class.'"</p>

<p>While we stood there awaiting a belated express,
a lady came up the stairs, who immediately attracted
attention from every gentleman present.</p>

<p>She was certainly a stunner and no mistake.</p>

<p>When she sailed past with the carriage of a
duchess we both discovered that art had supplanted
nature in giving her cheeks such a delightful glow.</p>

<p>This gave me an opening.</p>

<p>Judkins had just been asserting that women are
as honest as men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not in all things, my
boy. A man will always
put up a sign 'Look out
for paint,' but did you ever
know a woman to do it?
Not on your sweet life."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 306px;">
<a href="images/i066large.jpg"><img src="images/i066.jpg" width="306" height="400" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>I never realized before how forgetful
sailors are as a class, until
the fact was brought to my attention
last summer down at the Long
Island resort we patronized.</p>

<p>Why, they had to weigh their anchor every time
they left port&mdash;you'd think they could remember the
weight easy enough.</p>

<p>And speaking about sailors reminds me of a queer
old character I once knew down at the docks.</p>

<p>For more than thirty years he had labored faithfully
at the same job, and stepped up to be paid
every Saturday night.</p>

<p>But at last there came a ruler "who knew not
Joseph," and the order went out that the old man be
discharged to make room for some younger favorite.</p>

<p>His son brought the sad news to him.</p>

<p>It seemed to stupefy the old fellow.</p>

<p>He went home that evening in a daze.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>

<p>Of course the old woman quickly saw that something
was wrong, and began to ask questions.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 342px;">
<a href="images/i067large.jpg"><img src="images/i067.jpg" width="342" height="400" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>"No, and I'm not sick at
all. They're after dischargin'
me down at the docks. I've
recaved me notice for next
month. I knowed it would
come. Sure I towld ye the
furrst day I wint to worruk
there I didn't think 'tw'ud be
a steady job, and be jabers, I wor roight."</p>

<p>Some accident prevented me from attending a
musicale given by a would-be friend the other evening.</p>

<p>When I met him later he expressed himself after
the usual style, about having missed me, but I had
loaded up my old blunderbuss, and gave him a corker.</p>

<p>"And we were sorry not to be with you, Jones,
but to tell you the truth, our cook had company unexpectedly,
and she needed us to fill out the card
tables."</p>

<p>Jones never speaks to me now.</p>

<p>I really imagine the fellow believed what I told
him, which speaks well for my veracity.</p>

<p>Not that it matters much anyhow, for I understand
they will soon move out of our neighborhood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<p>My wife says the signs are infallible, since they
have begun to scratch matches on the walls.</p>

<p>By some accident I dropped into a strange barber
shop to be shaved.</p>

<p>And it was the most&mdash;well, atrocious skin I ever
ran up against.</p>

<p>The tears stood in my eyes, but that barbarian
kept scratching away just as though he had taken a
vow not to leave an inch of cuticle on my chin.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 348px;">
<a href="images/i068large.jpg"><img src="images/i068.jpg" width="348" height="400" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>When the agony became
unbearable, I said,
humbly:</p>

<p>"I beg pardon, but I
believe there's a hack in
your razor."</p>

<p>"Well," said he, coldly,
"what did you expect
to find in it&mdash;an automobile?"</p>

<p>We were doing Florida with a Pennsylvania excursion.</p>

<p>There was a very modest young lady from
Boston with our party and a ranch owner from
Oklahoma.</p>

<p>I chanced to be near when they were introduced.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<p>"I understand you've
traveled some in the
West, Miss Beacon?"
he said.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="images/i069large.jpg"><img src="images/i069.jpg" width="400" height="307" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>"Why, yes; quite extensively.
I've been
through California,
Arizona and New Mexico, where I was shown all
the wonderful sights."</p>

<p>"Did you ever see the Cherokee Strip?" he asked,
anxious to tell of his broad domain in that wonderland.</p>

<p>There was a painful silence, but finally she looked
over her glasses at him, and said:</p>

<p>"In the first place, sir, I deem your question exceedingly
rude; and in the second, you might have
been more refined in your language by asking me if I
had ever seen the Cherokee disrobe."</p>

<p>Occupying a seat just in front of me in the Pullman,
was a young couple, evidently recently engaged.</p>

<p>Occasionally fragments of their conversation
came to my ears, though I give you my word I was
not endeavoring to pry into their secrets.</p>

<p>I was, however, a little bit interested when I
heard him say:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>

<p>"I believe you cared for me the first time we ever
met."</p>

<p>"Why, what makes you think so?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"Because you kept looking at me steadily. Every
time I glanced in your direction your gaze was
riveted upon me."</p>

<p>The girl laughed in glee.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 355px;">
<a href="images/i070large.jpg"><img src="images/i070.jpg" width="355" height="400" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>"Oh, but it wasn't
because I had fallen in
love with you. I was
thinking what a pity it
was there was no one
near and dear to you
who could tell you what
wretched taste you had
in neckties."</p>

<p>George was more subdued after that.</p>

<p>And I noticed that his necktie was in most excellent
taste.</p>

<p>Right across the aisle two ladies were condoling
with each other over the respective short-comings
of their husbands.</p>

<p>I wondered if that sort of thing was common,
and how John's ears would tingle during business
hours if he could only know how his little faults<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
were being held up to ridicule by the partner of his
bosom.</p>

<p>They did haul those poor fellows over the coals
good and hard, which I thought bad taste, considering
that it was only through the liberality of the
same that these ladies were now off on a month's
pleasure trip.</p>

<p>I heard one of them finally say:</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="images/i071large.jpg"><img src="images/i071.jpg" width="400" height="400" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>"So your husband always humiliates you when you
take him to church Sunday
morning? What
does he do&mdash;go to sleep
and snore like my unmannerly
husband?"</p>

<p>"Oh; it's worse than
that, I assure you. He
gives himself away so
wretchedly."</p>

<p>"How is that?" asked the other, eagerly, for much
as these ladies like to run their husbands down, they
seem to enjoy learning that there are others still
worse.</p>

<p>"Why, he always tries to sneak into church by the
side door," was the disgusted reply.</p>

<p>I assure you I had reason to believe that man's
home did not have much attraction for him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>

<p>Between New York and Philadelphia I ran across
an old acquaintance, seated with a stranger who
appeared to have a great affection for him.</p>

<p>He kept an arm on the seat back of my old friend
Reginald, and every now and then spoke to him
soothingly.</p>

<p>I was surprised at the change in Reginald.</p>

<p>There was an excited look in his face, and his eyes
rolled restlessly, but he knew me and shook hands.</p>

<p>"Why I haven't seen you for several weeks!
How's your health?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Poorly; every little thing-thong seems to affect
me lately. Well, at any rate, you are looking like a
king-kong."</p>

<p>"Feeling that way, except for a slight touch of
spring fever," I replied.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 324px;">
<a href="images/i072large.jpg"><img src="images/i072.jpg" width="324" height="400" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>"Yes; spring-sprong always
affects me, too&mdash;makes
my head ring-rong."</p>

<p>"What in thunder is the
matter with you, old man,
the way you've got to
talking?"</p>

<p>"Nothing-thong," said
Reginald, making a swinging
movement of his arm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
through empty air, as his friend backed away in
amazement and alarm.</p>

<p>"I hear that you have become a great devotee of
the fashionable fad of table tennis."</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, wildly; "I like to have my fling-flong,
and enjoy the banjo sing-song of the game of
ping-pong at every racquet's swing-swong, while the
celluloid sphere is on the wing-wong. I know that
game's the thing-thong&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Just then the gentleman seated alongside spoke
to him, and the poor fellow lapsed into silence.</p>

<p>I knew then that the dreadful ping-pong had
gotten in its work, and that he was on his way to a
sanitarium.</p>

<p>In Jacksonville I dropped into a restaurant with a
friend, a Wall Street man off for a rest.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="images/i073large.jpg"><img src="images/i073.jpg" width="400" height="400" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>Presently the waiter came
up.</p>

<p>"What'll you have to-day,
sah?" asked the waiter.
"We've got some nice lamb
wid green peas."</p>

<p>"Yes," said the Wall
Street operator, absent-mindedly, "let me have a
little lamb with greenbacks."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>

<p>You see its hard for those chaps to divorce themselves
from their business.</p>

<p>After a while I noticed an old tortoise-shell tabby
sitting on one of the tables.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 353px;">
<a href="images/i074large.jpg"><img src="images/i074.jpg" width="353" height="400" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>It was back a little, but in full view
of the patrons.</p>

<p>I wondered why none of the attendants
chased the beast away,
and my curiosity grew apace
until I mentioned it to my companion.</p>

<p>So we hazarded many a guess.</p>

<p>He said she was a standing ad of
the catsup.</p>

<p>I declared her duty was to keep tab on the
waiters.</p>

<p>After we had exhausted all the old chestnuts, and
strained our relations almost to the breaking point by
manufacturing some atrocious new jokes, we decided
to call the waiter to settle the matter.</p>

<p>He bent down and said mysteriously:</p>

<p>"You see, sah, we's got stewed rabbit on de bill
ob fare to-day, and de govenor, sah, he say as how
de customers like to hab de cat in evidence on dese
days."</p>

<p>When we left the cat was still there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>

<p>I like the refreshing honesty of that restaurant
man, don't you?</p>

<p>My wife and I had quite a spirited debate recently.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 380px;">
<a href="images/i075large.jpg"><img src="images/i075.jpg" width="380" height="400" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>It concerned our youngest, who had been getting
into trouble again, throwing
stones at a neighbor's cat, or
doing some such boyish misdemeanor,
and his mother expressed
her opinion that he
was surely a chip of the old
block.</p>

<p>This was not the first time I had heard her say
that.</p>

<p>And, the worst of it was, I recognized its truth.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, being a man, and the head of the
family, I thought I ought to protest.</p>

<p>"I suppose you believe the lad inherits all his
good qualities from you, and his evil propensities
from me?" I remarked, loftily.</p>

<p>"Certainly, I have good authority for it," she replied,
not disturbed in the least by my haughty
demeanor.</p>

<p>You see, she has known me a long time.</p>

<p>"Indeed," I said, "where do you get your authority?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh! from the Bible&mdash;you know it says that the
sins of the father shall be visited upon the children."</p>

<p>I rather guess she had me there.</p>

<p>All housewives dislike the good man to bring company
home with him unexpectedly.</p>

<p>I know this from sad experience.</p>

<p>And, consequently, I always aim to let my better
half know beforehand, so that she may prepare certain
dishes that she delights to set before company,
but which are strangers to our ordinary everyday bill
of fare.</p>

<p>Even the best of intentions are liable to go astray.</p>

<p>And on this occasion I certainly overstepped the
mark.</p>

<p>So I have taken a vow to abstain from slang
hereafter.</p>

<p>This is what happened:</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 396px;">
<a href="images/i076large.jpg"><img src="images/i076.jpg" width="396" height="400" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>I left two gentlemen
in the parlor, and
wended my way to the
realm where our meals
are usually prepared.</p>

<p>My wife met me in
the dining-room, and
her face told me she
was not happy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>

<p>"Surely you haven't brought any one home with
you?" she said.</p>

<p>"Why, yes, my dear. You remember, of course, I
told you this morning I would."</p>

<p>"Of course, not. You told me you'd bring home a
couple of lobsters for dinner."</p>

<p>"Well, that's them in the parlor."</p>

<p>I finally compromised matters by taking a party of
four to a neighboring restaurant, and that lobster
episode cost me just ten dollars.</p>

<p>I had an embarassing moment the other day.</p>

<p>Le'me tell you how it was.</p>

<p>Some business took me to a certain quarter over
in Newark, to see a man about a matter of importance.</p>

<p>He was out, but expected in shortly.</p>

<p>So I said I would wait, for it meant nearly half a
day wasted if I had my trip for nothing.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 355px;">
<a href="images/i077large.jpg"><img src="images/i077.jpg" width="355" height="400" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>The old lady gave me a chair in the
kitchen, for they were good,
honest German folks, you
know.</p>

<p>I soon became interested
watching a young girl who
was busily engaged kneading
bread.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>

<p>Casual observation induced me to believe she
might be about twelve years of age.</p>

<p>After some time, I broke the silence by remarking:</p>

<p>"Don't you go to school?"</p>

<p>"No; I stopped school some time ago," she replied,
smiling.</p>

<p>"I should think that a girl of your age would want
to get as much education as possible before taking
the responsibility attending household duties," I said.</p>

<p>"Yes, maybe."</p>

<p>"But why don't you go to school, then?"</p>

<p>"Well," she stammered, "because my husband
thinks I had better stay at home."</p>

<p>About that time something occurring outside the
window attracted my attention.</p>

<p>I don't believe I've ever felt so cheap since I was
a boy and used to join the other fellows in a genuine
old country serenade when
a wedding took place.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 370px;">
<a href="images/i078large.jpg"><img src="images/i078.jpg" width="370" height="400" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>Did I tell you about it?</p>

<p>Well, this is what happened:</p>

<p>We heard that there
was to be a wedding over
at old Squire Joskins'&mdash;a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
niece of his had come home to be married to some
fellow or other.</p>

<p>Little we cared.</p>

<p>A wedding was all the same to us, if we could
only indulge in a downright rollicking shivaree.</p>

<p>So a lot of us got together&mdash;I guess there was a
dozen.</p>

<p>We had fishhorns and cowbells and tin pans
galore.</p>

<p>Well, the racket we put up was enough to wake
up the dead.</p>

<p>An hour went by, and not even a light showed.</p>

<p>This made us mad, for you see it's customary after
a time to beg off from the serenade by calling the
boys in and giving a spread.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 272px;">
<a href="images/i079large.jpg"><img src="images/i079.jpg" width="272" height="400" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>We did it some more.</p>

<p>Another hour passed.</p>

<p>There was a lot of tired arms
and ringing ears in that gang&mdash;say,
we could hardly talk above a
whisper.</p>

<p>Yet, with true American
grit, we were determined to
keep the ball rolling until we
dropped dead or they gave in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>

<p>I think it must have been near the end of the
third watch that I saw a head with a nightcap on it
stuck out of a second-story window.</p>

<p>Immediately we all quit pounding and waited to
hear the glad summons.</p>

<p>And this is what old Squire Joskins said:</p>

<p>"Don't stop if you're havin' a good time, boys.
You ain't disturbin' nobody. The young folks that
was married here this evenin' are both deaf and
dumb."</p>

<p>Then the window was lowered and deep silence
immediately began to reign.</p>

<p>We went home.</p>

<p>If any one tells you we are losing our fine sense
of humor, don't you believe it.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 399px;">
<a href="images/i080large.jpg"><img src="images/i080.jpg" width="399" height="400" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>To my mind as the years go
on, human nature is taking
more and more interest
in whatever pertains
to the funny side of life.</p>

<p>The growth of vaudeville
proves it.</p>

<p>At the same time I must say some people go to
extremes, like a certain individual I happened to run
across one night on the Bowery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<p>I chanced to be passing a tough joint near Grand
Street when they were ejecting a foreigner who bore
all the signs of extremely rough usage, nevertheless
was laughing immoderately.</p>

<p>"What is the joke?" I asked, holding him up.</p>

<p>"Why," said he, "a man came up to me in the bar
just now, gave me a fearful punch on the nose, and
said, 'Take that, you blooming Norwegian,'" and he
fell to laughing again as though
his sides would split.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 328px;">
<a href="images/i081large.jpg"><img src="images/i081.jpg" width="328" height="400" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>I was interested, and said:</p>

<p>"Just so, but I don't see anything
so funny about that."</p>

<p>"You don't, eh? That's queer,"
the man answered; "but then he
hit me a crack in the eyes, and afterward knocked
out one of my teeth, saying, 'And take that, too, you
blooming Norwegian.'"</p>

<p>"But still I can't see anything funny," I protested.</p>

<p>"Ho! ho! ho!" the other yelled, "I made a fool of
him, for you see, mister, the joke is that I'm a
Swede."</p>

<p>They make it as easy as possible these days for
those who want to become citizens.</p>

<p>Ever been on the scene when a lot of these fellows
line up to be naturalized?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<p>My friend, Clerk Donovan, down at City Hall,
through whose hands the applications go, says it's
as good as a circus.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 362px;">
<a href="images/i082large.jpg"><img src="images/i082.jpg" width="362" height="400" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>One red-faced son of the
Emerald Isle, whose carroty
hair looked like a
danger signal, stood in front
of Clerk Donovan the other
day, hoping to squeeze in.</p>

<p>It was necessary, before application
could be granted, that he should
show some familiarity with the style of government
in this country.</p>

<p>Evidently Pat had not been properly coached, and
hoped to pull through by natural assurance.</p>

<p>"Have you read the Declaration of Independence?"
asked Clerk Donovan.</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"Have you read the Constitution of the United
States?"</p>

<p>"I hov not."</p>

<p>"Well, then," cried Clerk Donovan, in an exasperated
tone, "have you read the history of the United
States?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>

<p>"No? Well, what in thunder have you read?"</p>

<p>"Oi have red hair on me head, your honor," said
the fellow, triumphantly.</p>

<p>He thought he had scored his point.</p>

<p>While I was dramatic editor on a metropolitan
paper I used to mingle with the actors a good deal.</p>

<p>That's how I took to my present calling.</p>

<p>A fellow came to a manager I knew, one day,
and wanted a berth.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 336px;">
<a href="images/i083large.jpg"><img src="images/i083.jpg" width="336" height="400" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>He had been a high roller
in his day, I guess, but had
of late been on his uppers.</p>

<p>The manager looked over
his list, and finally said:</p>

<p>"Well, that's the best I
can do for you. You've
been idle all season so far. Now,
will you remain idle all the rest of the year, or take
this small part?"</p>

<p>The actor considered a bit, and then made up his
mind.</p>

<p>"I'll take it," he said. "In this case a small role
is better than a whole loaf."</p>

<p>While I was attending the theatre in my official
capacity as a critic, wishing to obtain the various<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
opinions of those patrons whose views should be
valuable, I remember tackling a bald-headed man
with whom I had scraped an acquaintance.</p>

<p>"Do you think vaudeville should be reformed?" I
asked.</p>

<p>He grinned at me diabolically, and replied:</p>

<p>"No, but I'm of the positive opinion that some of
these soubrettes they've been springing on us lately
might be reformed all right."</p>

<p>Now, while dramatic editors may possibly know
something of music, they don't claim to be high art
critics.</p>

<p>The editor expects it, however.</p>

<p>He sent me to report a musicale once.</p>

<p>I dished it up to perfection I thought, with the
assistance of a friend, a
Bohemian who conducted an
orchestra in a Broadway
theatre.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 288px;">
<a href="images/i084large.jpg"><img src="images/i084.jpg" width="288" height="400" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>Judge of my surprise when
the editor had me on the
carpet the following day.</p>

<p>I knew his digestion was
bad, and that he meant to trip
me up on some mere trifle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>

<p>So I was on my guard.</p>

<p>"See here," he said, "did you do this write-up of
the concert last night?"</p>

<p>I confessed that it was my job.</p>

<p>He frowned and rapped the paper.</p>

<p>"I see you speak of the audience 'drinking in the
marvelous strains of the orchestra.' That is a hackneyed
phrase, I know, but tell me, how in the name
of Heaven can any one drink in music?"</p>

<p>"Well," I suggested, "one way I suppose it might
be done would be with a Rubinstein."</p>

<p>I should have been bounced, I know, but it was
my first offense, and the great editor let me down
easy.</p>

<p>Awowch! I've got it sure!</p>

<p>It's worse than being run over by a team of wild
horses.</p>

<p>Where it comes from no fellow can discover, and
once you've got it, look out, for it sticks closer than
a porous plaster.</p>

<p>My butcher has evidently grown weary of hearing
complaints regarding the high prices of meat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>

<p>And he is also suspicious of any one who begins
to talk of the grinding monopoly controlling the
market.</p>

<a href="images/i087large.jpg"><img src="images/i087.jpg" width="400" height="375" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>Why, it was only the other morning
he closed up a sour-looking
man so suddenly that I
fancy the fellow has not
up to this time got over
wondering what hit him.</p>

<p>"It's got so now," he began
to say, "that the infernal beef trust&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You won't find any beef trust at this shop, I'm
telling you right now&mdash;my terms are strictly cash,"
was what the cruel purveyor of loins and steaks
tossed at him.</p>

<p>And there was my old friend, the grocery man,
getting into hot water again when I entered.</p>

<p>He is used to it, being parboiled every day.</p>

<p>When I saw the same young matron who had
ordered "condemned milk" and those other astonishing
things the other day, I pricked up my ears, under
the belief that something rich, rare and racy might
happen.</p>

<p>It did.</p>

<p>"I've come to complain of that flour you sent me,"
she was saying, with fire in her eye.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>

<p>"What was the matter with it?" asked the grocer,
meekly.</p>

<p>"It was tough. I made a pie with it, and it
was as much as my husband could do to cut it,"
was what the dear young thing said in all candor.</p>

<p>And I suppose that grocer promised to remedy
matters by sending up some "tender" flour.</p>

<p>While I loitered in the grocer's who should come
in but Dr. Instantaneous, as gay and chipper as
though he had never killed a man in his thirty years
of deadly practice. He's a crank on the liquor
question, and to stave him off, I said:</p>

<p>"Terrible thing, that case of Sweitzer, the brewer."</p>

<p>"The brewer&mdash;yes, I've heard his name&mdash;what
happened to him?" he asked, innocently.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 398px;">
<a href="images/i088large.jpg"><img src="images/i088.jpg" width="398" height="400" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>"Dead."</p>

<p>"Why, it must have been
sudden."</p>

<p>"Very."</p>

<p>"How did he die?"</p>

<p>"Too much absorbed in his
business."</p>

<p>"What!"</p>

<p>"Fell into one of his beer vats and was drowned."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>

<p>Then the medical man smiled gently, but I knew he
would want to moralize on the story and I let fly
again.</p>

<p>"Notice that tall gentleman over yonder?" I said,
mysteriously.</p>

<p>"The one looking at those truffles?"</p>

<p>"Yes. What do you think of his looks?"</p>

<p>"A very homely individual."</p>

<p>"Wouldn't take him for a heart-smasher?"</p>

<p>"I guess not."</p>

<p>"Well, he's turned more girls' heads, I suppose,
than any other man in New York."</p>

<p>"H'm! a matinee idol, I suppose," grunted Dr. Instantaneous.</p>

<p>"Wrong. He's the manufacturer of the celebrated
Madame Justine's hair bleach."</p>

<a href="images/i089large.jpg"><img src="images/i089.jpg" width="323" height="400" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>"Well, doctor," I rattled
on, "days are getting pretty
short now. Why, d'ye know
the ink doesn't seem to
have time to dry on a thirty-day
note before it's due.
But tell me, doctor, have
you seen Prof. Bigsby
since he came back from
Martinique?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<p>"Has he really returned, then?" he asked, in surprise.</p>

<p>"Yes, they thought he had the measles, and sent
him home as an invalid."</p>

<p>"Did he have them?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Hope it wasn't smallpox, then?"</p>

<p>"Nothing so serious. You see, during his investigations
with regard to the causes of the volcanic
disturbances, the professor must have swallowed a
great quantity of lava dust. That was quite natural,
wasn't it?"</p>

<p>"I suppose so."</p>

<p>"Well, it stands to reason that an eruption followed."</p>

<p>Perhaps you know that I've taken something of a
prominent part in the agitation for merry-go-rounds in
the public parks, to better the condition of the
poor.</p>

<p>Seen my name among those of the committee,
haven't you? Well, a certain genius called Cropsey
dropped in on me to ask if it wouldn't be the proper
caper in connection with those merry-go-rounds to
enlist the sympathy and co-operation of the Daughters
of the Revolution.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>

<p>There! That ought to be enough to make you
weep, like you'd been peeling onions.</p>

<p>"Onions! Now there's something I'm particularly
fond of," he remarked.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="images/i090large.jpg"><img src="images/i090.jpg" width="400" height="389" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>"Ditto," I said, "the only
trouble about onions is that
when you eat them you
have to take so many
people into your confidence
about it."</p>

<p>Speaking about confidence, what do you think of
the sublime assurance of the monkey that lost his
hold on the branch of the tree, and fell into the
crocodile's waiting jaws? Even then his wits did
not desert him.</p>

<p>"I just dropped in for dinner," he said, with an engaging
smile.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 382px;">
<a href="images/i091large.jpg"><img src="images/i091.jpg" width="382" height="400" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>"It seems to me," remarked a business acquaintance,
"that our employees get more
assurance every day they live.
Now, there's that young bookkeeper
of mine. He asked me,
early in the week, whether I
could let him off to attend his
great-aunt's funeral."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span></p>

<p>"And what did you tell him?" I asked the man of
business.</p>

<p>"That it was impossible, as we were so overwhelmed
with work. He seemed to take it so to
heart that I felt a touch of pity for him, so I told
him that if business dropped off some I wouldn't
mind his going to a funeral, say on Saturday afternoon."</p>

<p>Had a great game of poker last night. Here's an
inch of horse-sense you poker-players will appreciate:</p>

<p>Zacharia, my barber, is quite a character.</p>

<p>I thought to joke him the last time he cut my hair.</p>

<p>"Look here," I remarked, "hair getting thin, eh?"</p>

<p>"Sure, it is."</p>

<p>"Seems to me you ought to charge me half price,
since the quantity has fallen off so."</p>

<p>"It would 'pear so, sah, but on de udder hand I
orter charge double price."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>

<p>"How's that, Zacharia?"</p>

<p>"Jest see what trouble I has to find it."</p>

<p>Last summer I took Zacchy out in the country
with me, as he wanted a change.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="images/i093large.jpg"><img src="images/i093.jpg" width="400" height="350" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>He did the chores
around the place, you
know, tended the horse,
made the garden, cut
the lawn.</p>

<p>It was quite a change
for him.</p>

<p>And I guess he was awful glad
to get back to town again.</p>

<p>Well, Zacchy has a pretty good disposition, easy-going,
you know, like most darkies.</p>

<p>My wife noticed that right away.</p>

<p>It takes the women to see through things.</p>

<p>And she had the strongest way of remedying the
trouble you ever heard of.</p>

<p>Would you believe it, one day she came to me all
smiles, and she said:</p>

<p>"George, dear, I want you to be sure and give
Zacharia a good scolding to-morrow morning."</p>

<p>I was surprised, and wondered what the fellow
had been doing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why not now?" I demanded, growing warm under
the collar at the idea of the darky having been impudent.</p>

<p>"No, no, restrain your impetuosity. I said to-morrow
morning.</p>

<p>"But what has he been doing?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing at all out of the way&mdash;he's such an
easy-going chap, you know."</p>

<p>"Well," I said, "I don't understand. Zacchy's all
right, and I quite fancy him. Now, why should I
scold him in the morning?"</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 392px;">
<a href="images/i094large.jpg"><img src="images/i094.jpg" width="392" height="400" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>"You see, he has to beat
the carpets to-morrow, and
strikes ever so much harder
when he's in a bad temper."</p>

<p>What do you think of
that?</p>

<p>Who, but a woman could have
conceived such a master stroke of
genius?</p>

<p>I often feel compelled to take off my hat to Mrs.
Niblo.</p>

<p>Why, we were discussing a particular lady friend
who was noted for her eccentricities.</p>

<p>"She's such a stickler for doing everything appropriately,"
I chanced to remark.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, I should say so," chimed in my better half,
who had delighted to take note of these things; "why,
she always does her marketing in a basket-phaeton."</p>

<p>I've had a little experience in building, and of
course paid for it, as all men do.</p>

<p>They were putting an addition on my country
house.</p>

<p>I call it by that name, for it sounds well.</p>

<p>I am generally a particular man, believing in the
motto "A place for everything and everything in its
place."</p>

<p>The boss carpenter annoyed
me.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 377px;">
<a href="images/i095large.jpg"><img src="images/i095.jpg" width="377" height="400" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>He seemed very careless&mdash;why,
he would leave his
tools just where he dropped
them, and it took me half an
hour every evening going
around collecting the same.</p>

<p>Finally, I thought to reprove him gently.</p>

<p>"My friend, suppose some one should drop in here
and get away with some of the valuable tools you
let lie around. It would be a serious loss."</p>

<p>"Don't lose any sleep about it, my friend," he said,
"all those things will be found in your bill."</p>

<p>Why, would you believe it, that same carpenter
used to bring his dog around with him and charged
me for his meals. That dog got so fat no sausage-maker
could pass him by without a sigh.</p>

<p>I heard of a meditative kind of terrier that got
grabbed up by a sausage-man the other day.</p>

<p>"Well," moaned the dog, as the net fell over him,
"of all the unlucky dogs, I guess I'm the worst yet."</p>

<p>"No," chuckled the sausage-man, "you are not
the wurst yet, but you pretty soon will be!"</p>

<p>Well, talking about sausages has made me hungry,
so we'll call it off till we meet again.</p>

<p>No bouquets, please!</p>
